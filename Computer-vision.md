Call for papers

Image restoration and image enhancement are key computer vision tasks, aiming at the restoration of degraded image content or the filling in of missing information. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.

Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, with image restoration or enhancement serving as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.

This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.

Papers addressing topics related to image restoration and enhancement are invited. The topics include, but are not limited to:

    Image/video inpainting
    Image/video deblurring
    Image/video denoising
    Image/video upsampling and super-resolution
    Image/video filtering
    Image/video dehazing
    Demosaicing
    Image/video compression
    Artifact removal
    Image/video enhancement: brightening, color adjustment, sharpening, etc.
    Style transfer
    Image/video generation and hallucination
    Image/video quality assessment
    Hyperspectral imaging
    Underwater imaging
    Aerial and satellite imaging
    Methods robust to changing weather conditions / adverse outdoor conditions
    Studies and applications of the above.

NTIRE 2018 has the following associated challenges:

    the example-based single image super-resolution challenge
    the image dehazing challenge
    the spectral reconstruction from RGB images challenge

The authors of the top methods in each category will be invited to submit papers to NTIRE 2018 workshop.
